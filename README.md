# My Old Blog created with Next.js's Static Generation

A large majority of this blog is based off of Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) blog example. I will use this blog to write more about certain topics. :)

Update: I've now depricated this blog and integrated it within my own Next.js website available here[https://saurish.com]. Let me know if you have any questions about any of the information listed here.
